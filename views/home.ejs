      <p>During a harsh winter when Jen experienced homelessness, she tragically lost 7 friends to the cold—a devastating experience that became the catalyst for her life-changing mission. Now, Jen has discovered an innovative solution: high-tech foam vests that are both affordable and incredibly effective, <span class="highlight">keeping people warm</span> in temperatures as low as 10 degrees below zero.</p>
      
      <p>These remarkable vests are more than just clothing—they're a lifeline for those most vulnerable to winter's unforgiving conditions. By providing critical warmth and protection, these vests can literally <span class="highlight">save lives</span> and reduce suffering  for individuals experiencing homelessness.</p>
